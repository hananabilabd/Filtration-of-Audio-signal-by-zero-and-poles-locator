# Filtration-of-Audio-signal-by-zero-and-poles-locator

Filtration of Audio signal by zero and poles graphical manipulation and   plotting the Fourier magnitude and phase in both 2 cases before  and after filtration
-First we select the filter we want by putting zero and poles into the unit circle
-then we browse the .Wav file we wanna apply the filter on 
-3 Graphs for Offline Filtration before manipulation appears after browsing for the .wav file ,the signal in time domain (time &amplitude) , the signal in Fourier transform for magnitude and the Signal in Fourier transform for phase
- we then apply the offline filter (we convert the signal to Fourier then apply the frequency response on it) and hear the sound after applying filter
- we can also apply online filter on the selected .wav file (Apply digital filter without convert the signal to Fourier first  )
- 3 Graphs for Online Filtration : time domain (amplitude & time ), Magnitude in Fourier transform (frequency & amplitude ) and Phase in Fourier transform (frequency & amplitude)
